# 🔐 MrHunter - AI Assisted Security & Compliance Agent

An advanced, zero-infrastructure security and regulatory compliance scanner built specifically for **Claude Code**.

By leveraging Claude's native reasoning capabilities and local file tools, this plugin acts as an automated triage layer. It performs:
- **SAST** — Static Application Security Testing
- **DAST Simulation** — Runtime API attack simulation
- **Secret Hunting** — Detects 30+ types of exposed credentials
- **Compliance Auditing** — Checks against 7 major Indian regulatory frameworks (DPDP Act, IT Act, PCI DSS, CERT-IN, RBI, SEBI, IRDAI)

No servers. No API keys. No background services. Just Claude.

## 🚀 How to Use This in Claude Code

> **The entire plugin is just a `.claude/` folder with markdown files.** When you copy it into your project and open Claude Code, your slash commands are automatically registered and ready.

### ✅ Step 1 — Install Git (if not already installed)
Make sure you have [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

---

### ✅ Step 2 — Clone this repo into your project

Open a terminal in the **root of your project** and run:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheWildEye/Petpooja-security.git _tmp_agent && cp -r _tmp_agent/.claude ./ && rm -rf _tmp_agent
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/TheWildEye/Petpooja-security.git _tmp_agent; Copy-Item -Recurse _tmp_agent/.claude ./ ; Remove-Item -Recurse -Force _tmp_agent
```

This will copy only the `.claude/` plugin folder into your project — nothing else.

---

### ✅ Step 3 — Open Claude Code in your project

```bash
claude
```

---

### ✅ Step 4 — Run a scan

Just type any of the registered slash commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/tiger-security-assess` | Full scan: SAST + DAST simulation + Secret hunting + Compliance audit |
| `/tiger-compliance-audit` | Deep Indian regulatory audit (DPDP, IT Act, PCI DSS, CERT-IN, RBI, SEBI, IRDAI) |
| `/tiger-quick-scan` | Fast SAST + secret scan only (no DAST, no compliance) |
| `/tiger-fix-issue` | Interactively fix a specific vulnerability with before/after diff |

That's it. No `npm install`, no `pip install`, no API keys.

---

## 🔁 Updating the Plugin

To get the latest version of the plugin rules and engines, simply re-run the clone command from Step 2 in your project root. It will overwrite the `.claude/` folder with the latest version.

## ⚙️ Alternative: One-Line Install Scripts

If you prefer scripts over the manual clone:

**macOS & Linux:**
```bash
# Project-level (current directory only)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWildEye/Petpooja-security/main/install.sh | bash

# Global installation (available in every project)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWildEye/Petpooja-security/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --global
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Project-level
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWildEye/Petpooja-security/main/install.ps1 | iex

# Global
$s = irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheWildEye/Petpooja-security/main/install.ps1; & ([scriptblock]::Create($s)) -Global
```

## 🔒 Security & Data Privacy

This plugin is designed with strict privacy controls baked in:

- **Local-only processing:** All scans run entirely on your machine using Claude Code's file tools. Nothing leaves your computer.
- **No data exfiltration:** The agents are explicitly instructed not to make external HTTP requests or transmit code, secrets, or findings anywhere.
- **Passive analysis only:** The plugin reads and reasons about code as text. It never executes or evaluates the code it scans.
- **Prompt injection defense:** If any file in your repository contains text attempting to hijack or override the agent (e.g., "ignore previous instructions"), it is flagged as a `CWE-77` security finding and the agent continues unaffected.

## 🔒 Auto-Fix Safety Tiers

| Tier | Risk | Auto-apply? | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 0 | Zero-risk | ✅ Auto | Add security headers |
| Tier 1 | Low-risk config | ✅ Auto + notify | Remove debug mode |
| Tier 2 | Code changes | ⚠️ Show diff, confirm | Parameterize SQL queries |
| Tier 3 | Auth/crypto/business logic | ❌ Never auto | Rewrite JWT flow |

---
