### DPDP Code Patterns
```
# Violation: Form without consent
<form action="/signup" method="POST">  <!-- No consent checkbox before submit -->

# Violation: Pre-ticked consent
<input type="checkbox" checked={true} />  <!-- Consent not freely given -->
<input type="checkbox" checked="checked" />

# Violation: Data collection before consent
document.cookie = "tracking=1";  <!-- Set before consent banner interaction -->
analytics.track("pageview");  <!-- Tracking before consent -->

# Violation: Bundled consent
<input type="checkbox" id="consent" /> I agree to all terms  <!-- Single checkbox for everything -->

# Violation: No withdrawal
<!-- No UI element to revoke consent, no /revoke-consent endpoint -->

# Violation: No age gate
<!-- Signup form without date of birth or age verification step -->

# Fix: Proper consent
<input type="checkbox" id="marketing-consent" /> Marketing emails
<input type="checkbox" id="analytics-consent" /> Analytics tracking
<!-- Each purpose has its own unchecked checkbox -->

## 💳 PCI DSS 4.0 (Payment Card Industry)

**Auto-detect trigger:** Stripe, Razorpay, PayU, PayPal imports; card number patterns; payment-related code.

| # | Check | What to Detect | Requirement | Risk |
|---|-------|---------------|-------------|------|

| PCI2 | No TLS for card transmission | Payment data sent over HTTP | Req 4 | Data interception |
| PCI3 | Hardcoded payment credentials | Stripe/Razorpay/PayU keys in source | Req 2, 8 | Credential exposure |
| PCI4 | No access control on payment data | Payment endpoints without auth middleware | Req 7 | Unauthorized access |
| PCI5 | No MFA on admin/payment panels | Admin routes without 2FA | Req 8.4 | Brute force risk |
| PCI6 | No audit logging for payments | Payment transactions not logged | Req 10 | No forensic trail |
| PCI7 | No vulnerability scanning | No SAST/DAST in payment flow | Req 11 | Compliance gap |
| PCI8 | Default credentials | `admin/admin`, `test/test` in prod config | Req 2 | Instant compromise |
| PCI9 | No SBOM for payment deps | Third-party payment libs not tracked | Req 6 | Supply chain risk |

### PCI Code Patterns
```
# Violation: Card data in plaintext
db.execute("INSERT INTO orders (card_number) VALUES (?)", card_num)
# card_number column not encrypted

# Violation: Payment over HTTP
fetch("http://api.example.com/charge", { body: { card: cardNumber } })

# Violation: Hardcoded keys
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = "sk_live_51H..."
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET = "rzp_live_..."

# Fix: Use tokenization
stripe.tokens.create({ card: { number, exp_month, exp_year, cvc } })
# Never store raw card — use Stripe/Razorpay tokens
```
